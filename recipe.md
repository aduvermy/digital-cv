## Cooking tips

**bread** 🌿

In a mixing bowl:

- flour: 500 g
- salt: 5 g
- fresh yeast: 25 g
- water: 300 ml - 25°C <br>

⚠️ Do not put yeast and salt directly in contact, or your yeast won't activate. <br>
<br>
Mix and knead to obtain a dough. <br>
Let it rest for 3 hours at ~25°C. <br>
After 3 hours, remove the dough and knead again, adding flour if needed. <br>
Shape into bread and place in the oven. <br>
<br>
My tip: In a small bowl, mix a small amount of nut oil, hot water, and salt. Brush the bread with this mixture before baking.
