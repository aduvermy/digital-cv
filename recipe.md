## Cooking tips

** bread ** :herb:

In a mixing bowl:

- flour: 500 g
- salt: 5 g
- fresh yeast: 25 g
- water: 300 ml - 25Â°C
:warning: Do not put yeast and salt directly in contact, or your yeast won't activate.

Mix and knead to obtain a dough.
Let it rest for 3 hours at ~25Â°C.
After 3 hours, remove the dough and knead again, adding flour if needed.
Shape into bread and place in the oven.

My tip: In a small bowl, mix a small amount of nut oil, hot water, and salt. Brush the bread with this mixture before baking.
